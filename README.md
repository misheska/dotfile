My Dotfile Repo - based on the lovely things I've discovered via
http://dotfiles.github.com

## Installation

To install on a new machine run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/misheska/dotfile
cd dotfile && ./dotfile.sh
```

To just print out what the script would do for debugging purposes, but not
actually execute commands, use the `-d` option to run in dry-run mode: `./dotfile.sh -d`
